Creator Notes
  - Growing up I really enjoyed testing myself with geography flashcards, which made
    perfect sense for me to implement this game for this project.
  - Using rust allowed me to simply yet effectivly create this project
    given my expirence with using it in the Rust project I did not
    long ago
  - Given the timing of this assignment with it being at the end of finals
    I belive I created a good base for this game, but in the near future I
    plan to implemnet more complex features and grow this game to be
    not only a trivia but a learning expirence

Future Plans
  - implement a time limit on the answering time
  - implemnt users that get saved so players can return
  - going off the users, also have a leaderboard
  - and hopefully more difficulties!!

Stay tuned!!!!
